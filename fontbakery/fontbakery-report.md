* [com.google.fonts/check/contour_count](https://font-bakery.readthedocs.io/en/latest/fontbakery/profiles/googlefonts.html#com.google.fonts/check/contour_count)
<pre>--- Rationale ---
Visually QAing thousands of glyphs by hand is tiring. Most glyphs can only be
constructured in a handful of ways. This means a glyph&#x27;s contour count will only
differ slightly amongst different fonts, e.g a &#x27;g&#x27; could either be 2 or 3
contours, depending on whether its double story or single story.
However, a quotedbl should have 2 contours, unless the font belongs to a display
family.
This check currently does not cover variable fonts because there&#x27;s plenty of
alternative ways of constructing glyphs with multiple outlines for each feature
in a VarFont. The expected contour count data for this check is currently
optimized for the typical construction of glyphs in static fonts.</pre>

* ⚠ **WARN** This check inspects the glyph outlines and detects the total number of contours in each of them. The expected values are infered from the typical ammounts of contours observed in a large collection of reference font families. The divergences listed below may simply indicate a significantly different design on some of your glyphs. On the other hand, some of these may flag actual bugs in the font such as glyphs mapped to an incorrect codepoint. Please consider reviewing the design and codepoint assignment of these to make sure they are correct.

The following glyphs do not have the recommended number of contours:

<pre>--- Rationale ---
The OpenType &#x27;meta&#x27; table originated at Apple. Microsoft added it to OT with
just two DataMap records:
- dlng: comma-separated ScriptLangTags that indicate which scripts, or languages
and scripts, with possible variants, the font is designed for
- slng: comma-separated ScriptLangTags that indicate which scripts, or languages
and scripts, with possible variants, the font supports
The slng structure is intended to describe which languages and scripts the font
overall supports. For example, a Traditional Chinese font that also contains
Latin characters, can indicate Hant,Latn, showing that it supports Hant, the
Traditional Chinese variant of the Hani script, and it also supports the Latn
script
The dlng structure is far more interesting. A font may contain various glyphs,
but only a particular subset of the glyphs may be truly &quot;leading&quot; in the design,
while other glyphs may have been included for technical reasons. Such a
Traditional Chinese font could only list Hant there, showing that it’s designed
for Traditional Chinese, but the font would omit Latn, because the developers
don’t think the font is really recommended for purely Latin-script use.
The tags used in the structures can comprise just script, or also language and
script. For example, if a font has Bulgarian Cyrillic alternates in the locl
feature for the cyrl BGR OT languagesystem, it could also indicate in dlng
explicitly that it supports bul-Cyrl. (Note that the scripts and languages in
meta use the ISO language and script codes, not the OpenType ones).
This check ensures that the font has the meta table containing the slng and dlng
structures.
All families in the Google Fonts collection should contain the &#x27;meta&#x27; table.
Windows 10 already uses it when deciding on which fonts to fall back to. The
Google Fonts API and also other environments could use the data for smarter
filtering. Most importantly, those entries should be added to the Noto fonts.
In the font making process, some environments store this data in external files
already. But the meta table provides a convenient way to store this inside the
font file, so some tools may add the data, and unrelated tools may read this
data. This makes the solution much more portable and universal.</pre>

* [com.google.fonts/check/outline_alignment_miss](https://font-bakery.readthedocs.io/en/latest/fontbakery/profiles/<Section: Outline Correctness Checks>.html#com.google.fonts/check/outline_alignment_miss)
<pre>--- Rationale ---
This check heuristically looks for on-curve points which are close to, but do
not sit on, significant boundary coordinates. For example, a point which has a
Y-coordinate of 1 or -1 might be a misplaced baseline point. As well as the
baseline, here we also check for points near the x-height (but only for lower
case Latin letters), cap-height, ascender and descender Y coordinates.
Not all such misaligned curve points are a mistake, and sometimes the design may
call for points in locations near the boundaries. As this check is liable to
generate significant numbers of false positives, it will pass if there are more
than 100 reported misalignments.</pre>

<pre>--- Rationale ---
Visually QAing thousands of glyphs by hand is tiring. Most glyphs can only be
constructured in a handful of ways. This means a glyph&#x27;s contour count will only
differ slightly amongst different fonts, e.g a &#x27;g&#x27; could either be 2 or 3
contours, depending on whether its double story or single story.
However, a quotedbl should have 2 contours, unless the font belongs to a display
family.
This check currently does not cover variable fonts because there&#x27;s plenty of
alternative ways of constructing glyphs with multiple outlines for each feature
in a VarFont. The expected contour count data for this check is currently
optimized for the typical construction of glyphs in static fonts.</pre>

* ⚠ **WARN** This check inspects the glyph outlines and detects the total number of contours in each of them.

The divergences listed below may simply indicate a significantly different design on some of your glyphs. On the other hand, some of these may flag actual bugs in the font such as glyphs mapped to an incorrect codepoint.

<pre>--- Rationale ---
The OpenType &#x27;meta&#x27; table originated at Apple. Microsoft added it to OT with
just two DataMap records:
- dlng: comma-separated ScriptLangTags that indicate which scripts, or languages
and scripts, with possible variants, the font is designed for
- slng: comma-separated ScriptLangTags that indicate which scripts, or languages
and scripts, with possible variants, the font supports
The slng structure is intended to describe which languages and scripts the font
overall supports. For example, a Traditional Chinese font that also contains
Latin characters, can indicate Hant,Latn, showing that it supports Hant, the
Traditional Chinese variant of the Hani script, and it also supports the Latn
script
The dlng structure is far more interesting. A font may contain various glyphs,
but only a particular subset of the glyphs may be truly &quot;leading&quot; in the design,
while other glyphs may have been included for technical reasons. Such a
Traditional Chinese font could only list Hant there, showing that it’s designed
for Traditional Chinese, but the font would omit Latn, because the developers
don’t think the font is really recommended for purely Latin-script use.
The tags used in the structures can comprise just script, or also language and
script. For example, if a font has Bulgarian Cyrillic alternates in the locl
feature for the cyrl BGR OT languagesystem, it could also indicate in dlng
explicitly that it supports bul-Cyrl. (Note that the scripts and languages in
meta use the ISO language and script codes, not the OpenType ones).
This check ensures that the font has the meta table containing the slng and dlng
structures.
All families in the Google Fonts collection should contain the &#x27;meta&#x27; table.
Windows 10 already uses it when deciding on which fonts to fall back to. The
Google Fonts API and also other environments could use the data for smarter
filtering. Most importantly, those entries should be added to the Noto fonts.
In the font making process, some environments store this data in external files
already. But the meta table provides a convenient way to store this inside the
font file, so some tools may add the data, and unrelated tools may read this
data. This makes the solution much more portable and universal.</pre>

<pre>--- Rationale ---
This check heuristically looks for on-curve points which are close to, but do
not sit on, significant boundary coordinates. For example, a point which has a
Y-coordinate of 1 or -1 might be a misplaced baseline point. As well as the
baseline, here we also check for points near the x-height (but only for lower
case Latin letters), cap-height, ascender and descender Y coordinates.
Not all such misaligned curve points are a mistake, and sometimes the design may
call for points in locations near the boundaries. As this check is liable to
generate significant numbers of false positives, it will pass if there are more
than 100 reported misalignments.</pre>

<pre>--- Rationale ---
The OpenType &#x27;meta&#x27; table originated at Apple. Microsoft added it to OT with
just two DataMap records:
- dlng: comma-separated ScriptLangTags that indicate which scripts, or languages
and scripts, with possible variants, the font is designed for
- slng: comma-separated ScriptLangTags that indicate which scripts, or languages
and scripts, with possible variants, the font supports
The slng structure is intended to describe which languages and scripts the font
overall supports. For example, a Traditional Chinese font that also contains
Latin characters, can indicate Hant,Latn, showing that it supports Hant, the
Traditional Chinese variant of the Hani script, and it also supports the Latn
script
The dlng structure is far more interesting. A font may contain various glyphs,
but only a particular subset of the glyphs may be truly &quot;leading&quot; in the design,
while other glyphs may have been included for technical reasons. Such a
Traditional Chinese font could only list Hant there, showing that it’s designed
for Traditional Chinese, but the font would omit Latn, because the developers
don’t think the font is really recommended for purely Latin-script use.
The tags used in the structures can comprise just script, or also language and
script. For example, if a font has Bulgarian Cyrillic alternates in the locl
feature for the cyrl BGR OT languagesystem, it could also indicate in dlng
explicitly that it supports bul-Cyrl. (Note that the scripts and languages in
meta use the ISO language and script codes, not the OpenType ones).
This check ensures that the font has the meta table containing the slng and dlng
structures.
All families in the Google Fonts collection should contain the &#x27;meta&#x27; table.
Windows 10 already uses it when deciding on which fonts to fall back to. The
Google Fonts API and also other environments could use the data for smarter
filtering. Most importantly, those entries should be added to the Noto fonts.
In the font making process, some environments store this data in external files
already. But the meta table provides a convenient way to store this inside the
font file, so some tools may add the data, and unrelated tools may read this
data. This makes the solution much more portable and universal.</pre>

<pre>--- Rationale ---
This check heuristically looks for on-curve points which are close to, but do
not sit on, significant boundary coordinates. For example, a point which has a
Y-coordinate of 1 or -1 might be a misplaced baseline point. As well as the
baseline, here we also check for points near the x-height (but only for lower
case Latin letters), cap-height, ascender and descender Y coordinates.
Not all such misaligned curve points are a mistake, and sometimes the design may
call for points in locations near the boundaries. As this check is liable to
generate significant numbers of false positives, it will pass if there are more
than 100 reported misalignments.</pre>

<pre>--- Rationale ---
Visually QAing thousands of glyphs by hand is tiring. Most glyphs can only be
constructured in a handful of ways. This means a glyph&#x27;s contour count will only
differ slightly amongst different fonts, e.g a &#x27;g&#x27; could either be 2 or 3
contours, depending on whether its double story or single story.
However, a quotedbl should have 2 contours, unless the font belongs to a display
family.
This check currently does not cover variable fonts because there&#x27;s plenty of
alternative ways of constructing glyphs with multiple outlines for each feature
in a VarFont. The expected contour count data for this check is currently
optimized for the typical construction of glyphs in static fonts.</pre>

* ⚠ **WARN** This check inspects the glyph outlines and detects the total number of contours in each of them. The expected values are infered from the typical ammounts of contours observed in a large collection of reference font families.

<pre>--- Rationale ---
The OpenType &#x27;meta&#x27; table originated at Apple. Microsoft added it to OT with
just two DataMap records:
- dlng: comma-separated ScriptLangTags that indicate which scripts, or languages
and scripts, with possible variants, the font is designed for
- slng: comma-separated ScriptLangTags that indicate which scripts, or languages
and scripts, with possible variants, the font supports
The slng structure is intended to describe which languages and scripts the font
overall supports. For example, a Traditional Chinese font that also contains
Latin characters, can indicate Hant,Latn, showing that it supports Hant, the
Traditional Chinese variant of the Hani script, and it also supports the Latn
script
The dlng structure is far more interesting. A font may contain various glyphs,
but only a particular subset of the glyphs may be truly &quot;leading&quot; in the design,
while other glyphs may have been included for technical reasons. Such a
Traditional Chinese font could only list Hant there, showing that it’s designed
for Traditional Chinese, but the font would omit Latn, because the developers
don’t think the font is really recommended for purely Latin-script use.
The tags used in the structures can comprise just script, or also language and
script. For example, if a font has Bulgarian Cyrillic alternates in the locl
feature for the cyrl BGR OT languagesystem, it could also indicate in dlng
explicitly that it supports bul-Cyrl. (Note that the scripts and languages in
meta use the ISO language and script codes, not the OpenType ones).
This check ensures that the font has the meta table containing the slng and dlng
structures.
All families in the Google Fonts collection should contain the &#x27;meta&#x27; table.
Windows 10 already uses it when deciding on which fonts to fall back to. The
Google Fonts API and also other environments could use the data for smarter
filtering. Most importantly, those entries should be added to the Noto fonts.
In the font making process, some environments store this data in external files
already. But the meta table provides a convenient way to store this inside the
font file, so some tools may add the data, and unrelated tools may read this
data. This makes the solution much more portable and universal.</pre>

<pre>--- Rationale ---
This check heuristically looks for on-curve points which are close to, but do
not sit on, significant boundary coordinates. For example, a point which has a
Y-coordinate of 1 or -1 might be a misplaced baseline point. As well as the
baseline, here we also check for points near the x-height (but only for lower
case Latin letters), cap-height, ascender and descender Y coordinates.
Not all such misaligned curve points are a mistake, and sometimes the design may
call for points in locations near the boundaries. As this check is liable to
generate significant numbers of false positives, it will pass if there are more
than 100 reported misalignments.</pre>

<pre>--- Rationale ---
Visually QAing thousands of glyphs by hand is tiring. Most glyphs can only be
constructured in a handful of ways. This means a glyph&#x27;s contour count will only
differ slightly amongst different fonts, e.g a &#x27;g&#x27; could either be 2 or 3
contours, depending on whether its double story or single story.
However, a quotedbl should have 2 contours, unless the font belongs to a display
family.
This check currently does not cover variable fonts because there&#x27;s plenty of
alternative ways of constructing glyphs with multiple outlines for each feature
in a VarFont. The expected contour count data for this check is currently
optimized for the typical construction of glyphs in static fonts.</pre>

* ⚠ **WARN** This check inspects the glyph outlines and detects the total number of contours in each of them. The expected values are infered from the typical ammounts of contours observed in a large collection of reference font families. The divergences listed below may simply indicate a significantly different design on some of your glyphs. On the other hand, some of these may flag actual bugs in the font such as glyphs mapped to an incorrect codepoint.

After discussing the problem in more detail at `FontBakery issue #2179 [2] we

* [com.google.fonts/check/meta/script_lang_tags](https://font-bakery.readthedocs.io/en/latest/fontbakery/profiles/googlefonts.html#com.google.fonts/check/meta/script_lang_tags)
<pre>--- Rationale ---
The OpenType &#x27;meta&#x27; table originated at Apple. Microsoft added it to OT with
just two DataMap records:
- dlng: comma-separated ScriptLangTags that indicate which scripts, or languages
and scripts, with possible variants, the font is designed for
- slng: comma-separated ScriptLangTags that indicate which scripts, or languages
and scripts, with possible variants, the font supports
The slng structure is intended to describe which languages and scripts the font
overall supports. For example, a Traditional Chinese font that also contains
Latin characters, can indicate Hant,Latn, showing that it supports Hant, the
Traditional Chinese variant of the Hani script, and it also supports the Latn
script
The dlng structure is far more interesting. A font may contain various glyphs,
but only a particular subset of the glyphs may be truly &quot;leading&quot; in the design,
while other glyphs may have been included for technical reasons. Such a
Traditional Chinese font could only list Hant there, showing that it’s designed
for Traditional Chinese, but the font would omit Latn, because the developers
don’t think the font is really recommended for purely Latin-script use.
The tags used in the structures can comprise just script, or also language and
script. For example, if a font has Bulgarian Cyrillic alternates in the locl
feature for the cyrl BGR OT languagesystem, it could also indicate in dlng
explicitly that it supports bul-Cyrl. (Note that the scripts and languages in
meta use the ISO language and script codes, not the OpenType ones).
This check ensures that the font has the meta table containing the slng and dlng
structures.
All families in the Google Fonts collection should contain the &#x27;meta&#x27; table.
Windows 10 already uses it when deciding on which fonts to fall back to. The
Google Fonts API and also other environments could use the data for smarter
filtering. Most importantly, those entries should be added to the Noto fonts.
In the font making process, some environments store this data in external files
already. But the meta table provides a convenient way to store this inside the
font file, so some tools may add the data, and unrelated tools may read this
data. This makes the solution much more portable and universal.</pre>

<pre>--- Rationale ---
This check heuristically looks for on-curve points which are close to, but do
not sit on, significant boundary coordinates. For example, a point which has a
Y-coordinate of 1 or -1 might be a misplaced baseline point. As well as the
baseline, here we also check for points near the x-height (but only for lower
case Latin letters), cap-height, ascender and descender Y coordinates.
Not all such misaligned curve points are a mistake, and sometimes the design may
call for points in locations near the boundaries. As this check is liable to
generate significant numbers of false positives, it will pass if there are more
than 100 reported misalignments.</pre>

* [com.google.fonts/check/meta/script_lang_tags](https://font-bakery.readthedocs.io/en/latest/fontbakery/profiles/googlefonts.html#com.google.fonts/check/meta/script_lang_tags)
<pre>--- Rationale ---
The OpenType &#x27;meta&#x27; table originated at Apple. Microsoft added it to OT with
just two DataMap records:
- dlng: comma-separated ScriptLangTags that indicate which scripts, or languages
and scripts, with possible variants, the font is designed for
- slng: comma-separated ScriptLangTags that indicate which scripts, or languages
and scripts, with possible variants, the font supports
The slng structure is intended to describe which languages and scripts the font
overall supports. For example, a Traditional Chinese font that also contains
Latin characters, can indicate Hant,Latn, showing that it supports Hant, the
Traditional Chinese variant of the Hani script, and it also supports the Latn
script
The dlng structure is far more interesting. A font may contain various glyphs,
but only a particular subset of the glyphs may be truly &quot;leading&quot; in the design,
while other glyphs may have been included for technical reasons. Such a
Traditional Chinese font could only list Hant there, showing that it’s designed
for Traditional Chinese, but the font would omit Latn, because the developers
don’t think the font is really recommended for purely Latin-script use.
The tags used in the structures can comprise just script, or also language and
script. For example, if a font has Bulgarian Cyrillic alternates in the locl
feature for the cyrl BGR OT languagesystem, it could also indicate in dlng
explicitly that it supports bul-Cyrl. (Note that the scripts and languages in
meta use the ISO language and script codes, not the OpenType ones).
This check ensures that the font has the meta table containing the slng and dlng
structures.
All families in the Google Fonts collection should contain the &#x27;meta&#x27; table.
Windows 10 already uses it when deciding on which fonts to fall back to. The
Google Fonts API and also other environments could use the data for smarter
filtering. Most importantly, those entries should be added to the Noto fonts.
In the font making process, some environments store this data in external files
already. But the meta table provides a convenient way to store this inside the
font file, so some tools may add the data, and unrelated tools may read this
data. This makes the solution much more portable and universal.</pre>

<pre>--- Rationale ---
This check heuristically looks for on-curve points which are close to, but do
not sit on, significant boundary coordinates. For example, a point which has a
Y-coordinate of 1 or -1 might be a misplaced baseline point. As well as the
baseline, here we also check for points near the x-height (but only for lower
case Latin letters), cap-height, ascender and descender Y coordinates.
Not all such misaligned curve points are a mistake, and sometimes the design may
call for points in locations near the boundaries. As this check is liable to
generate significant numbers of false positives, it will pass if there are more
than 100 reported misalignments.</pre>

<pre>--- Rationale ---
The OpenType &#x27;meta&#x27; table originated at Apple. Microsoft added it to OT with
just two DataMap records:
- dlng: comma-separated ScriptLangTags that indicate which scripts, or languages
and scripts, with possible variants, the font is designed for
- slng: comma-separated ScriptLangTags that indicate which scripts, or languages
and scripts, with possible variants, the font supports
The slng structure is intended to describe which languages and scripts the font
overall supports. For example, a Traditional Chinese font that also contains
Latin characters, can indicate Hant,Latn, showing that it supports Hant, the
Traditional Chinese variant of the Hani script, and it also supports the Latn
script
The dlng structure is far more interesting. A font may contain various glyphs,
but only a particular subset of the glyphs may be truly &quot;leading&quot; in the design,
while other glyphs may have been included for technical reasons. Such a
Traditional Chinese font could only list Hant there, showing that it’s designed
for Traditional Chinese, but the font would omit Latn, because the developers
don’t think the font is really recommended for purely Latin-script use.
The tags used in the structures can comprise just script, or also language and
script. For example, if a font has Bulgarian Cyrillic alternates in the locl
feature for the cyrl BGR OT languagesystem, it could also indicate in dlng
explicitly that it supports bul-Cyrl. (Note that the scripts and languages in
meta use the ISO language and script codes, not the OpenType ones).
This check ensures that the font has the meta table containing the slng and dlng
structures.
All families in the Google Fonts collection should contain the &#x27;meta&#x27; table.
Windows 10 already uses it when deciding on which fonts to fall back to. The
Google Fonts API and also other environments could use the data for smarter
filtering. Most importantly, those entries should be added to the Noto fonts.
In the font making process, some environments store this data in external files
already. But the meta table provides a convenient way to store this inside the
font file, so some tools may add the data, and unrelated tools may read this
data. This makes the solution much more portable and universal.</pre>

<pre>--- Rationale ---
This check heuristically looks for on-curve points which are close to, but do
not sit on, significant boundary coordinates. For example, a point which has a
Y-coordinate of 1 or -1 might be a misplaced baseline point. As well as the
baseline, here we also check for points near the x-height (but only for lower
case Latin letters), cap-height, ascender and descender Y coordinates.
Not all such misaligned curve points are a mistake, and sometimes the design may
call for points in locations near the boundaries. As this check is liable to
generate significant numbers of false positives, it will pass if there are more
than 100 reported misalignments.</pre>

<pre>--- Rationale ---
The OpenType &#x27;meta&#x27; table originated at Apple. Microsoft added it to OT with
just two DataMap records:
- dlng: comma-separated ScriptLangTags that indicate which scripts, or languages
and scripts, with possible variants, the font is designed for
- slng: comma-separated ScriptLangTags that indicate which scripts, or languages
and scripts, with possible variants, the font supports
The slng structure is intended to describe which languages and scripts the font
overall supports. For example, a Traditional Chinese font that also contains
Latin characters, can indicate Hant,Latn, showing that it supports Hant, the
Traditional Chinese variant of the Hani script, and it also supports the Latn
script
The dlng structure is far more interesting. A font may contain various glyphs,
but only a particular subset of the glyphs may be truly &quot;leading&quot; in the design,
while other glyphs may have been included for technical reasons. Such a
Traditional Chinese font could only list Hant there, showing that it’s designed
for Traditional Chinese, but the font would omit Latn, because the developers
don’t think the font is really recommended for purely Latin-script use.
The tags used in the structures can comprise just script, or also language and
script. For example, if a font has Bulgarian Cyrillic alternates in the locl
feature for the cyrl BGR OT languagesystem, it could also indicate in dlng
explicitly that it supports bul-Cyrl. (Note that the scripts and languages in
meta use the ISO language and script codes, not the OpenType ones).
This check ensures that the font has the meta table containing the slng and dlng
structures.
All families in the Google Fonts collection should contain the &#x27;meta&#x27; table.
Windows 10 already uses it when deciding on which fonts to fall back to. The
Google Fonts API and also other environments could use the data for smarter
filtering. Most importantly, those entries should be added to the Noto fonts.
In the font making process, some environments store this data in external files
already. But the meta table provides a convenient way to store this inside the
font file, so some tools may add the data, and unrelated tools may read this

<pre>--- Rationale ---
This check heuristically looks for on-curve points which are close to, but do
not sit on, significant boundary coordinates. For example, a point which has a
Y-coordinate of 1 or -1 might be a misplaced baseline point. As well as the
baseline, here we also check for points near the x-height (but only for lower
case Latin letters), cap-height, ascender and descender Y coordinates.
Not all such misaligned curve points are a mistake, and sometimes the design may
call for points in locations near the boundaries. As this check is liable to
generate significant numbers of false positives, it will pass if there are more

<pre>--- Rationale ---
Visually QAing thousands of glyphs by hand is tiring. Most glyphs can only be
constructured in a handful of ways. This means a glyph&#x27;s contour count will only
differ slightly amongst different fonts, e.g a &#x27;g&#x27; could either be 2 or 3
contours, depending on whether its double story or single story.
However, a quotedbl should have 2 contours, unless the font belongs to a display
family.
This check currently does not cover variable fonts because there&#x27;s plenty of

in a VarFont. The expected contour count data for this check is currently
optimized for the typical construction of glyphs in static fonts.</pre>

<pre>--- Rationale ---
Visually QAing thousands of glyphs by hand is tiring. Most glyphs can only be
constructured in a handful of ways. This means a glyph&#x27;s contour count will only
differ slightly amongst different fonts, e.g a &#x27;g&#x27; could either be 2 or 3
contours, depending on whether its double story or single story.
However, a quotedbl should have 2 contours, unless the font belongs to a display
family.
This check currently does not cover variable fonts because there&#x27;s plenty of
alternative ways of constructing glyphs with multiple outlines for each feature
in a VarFont. The expected contour count data for this check is currently
optimized for the typical construction of glyphs in static fonts.</pre>

* ⚠ **WARN** This check inspects the glyph outlines and detects the total number of contours in each of them. The expected values are infered from the typical ammounts of contours observed in a large collection of reference font families. The divergences listed below may simply indicate a significantly different design on some of your glyphs. On the other hand, some of these may flag actual bugs in the font such as glyphs mapped to an incorrect codepoint. Please consider reviewing the design and codepoint assignment of these to make sure they are correct.

<pre>--- Rationale ---
The OpenType &#x27;meta&#x27; table originated at Apple. Microsoft added it to OT with
just two DataMap records:
- dlng: comma-separated ScriptLangTags that indicate which scripts, or languages
and scripts, with possible variants, the font is designed for
- slng: comma-separated ScriptLangTags that indicate which scripts, or languages
and scripts, with possible variants, the font supports
The slng structure is intended to describe which languages and scripts the font
overall supports. For example, a Traditional Chinese font that also contains
Latin characters, can indicate Hant,Latn, showing that it supports Hant, the
Traditional Chinese variant of the Hani script, and it also supports the Latn
script
The dlng structure is far more interesting. A font may contain various glyphs,
but only a particular subset of the glyphs may be truly &quot;leading&quot; in the design,
while other glyphs may have been included for technical reasons. Such a
Traditional Chinese font could only list Hant there, showing that it’s designed
for Traditional Chinese, but the font would omit Latn, because the developers
don’t think the font is really recommended for purely Latin-script use.
The tags used in the structures can comprise just script, or also language and
script. For example, if a font has Bulgarian Cyrillic alternates in the locl
feature for the cyrl BGR OT languagesystem, it could also indicate in dlng
explicitly that it supports bul-Cyrl. (Note that the scripts and languages in
meta use the ISO language and script codes, not the OpenType ones).
This check ensures that the font has the meta table containing the slng and dlng
structures.
All families in the Google Fonts collection should contain the &#x27;meta&#x27; table.
Windows 10 already uses it when deciding on which fonts to fall back to. The
Google Fonts API and also other environments could use the data for smarter
filtering. Most importantly, those entries should be added to the Noto fonts.
In the font making process, some environments store this data in external files
already. But the meta table provides a convenient way to store this inside the

<pre>--- Rationale ---
This check heuristically looks for on-curve points which are close to, but do
not sit on, significant boundary coordinates. For example, a point which has a
Y-coordinate of 1 or -1 might be a misplaced baseline point. As well as the
baseline, here we also check for points near the x-height (but only for lower
case Latin letters), cap-height, ascender and descender Y coordinates.
Not all such misaligned curve points are a mistake, and sometimes the design may
call for points in locations near the boundaries. As this check is liable to
generate significant numbers of false positives, it will pass if there are more

Microsoft keeps a list of font vendors and their respective contact info. This
list is updated regularly and is indexed by a 4-char &quot;Vendor ID&quot; which is stored
in the achVendID field of the OS/2 table.
Registering your ID is not mandatory, but it is a good practice since some
applications may display the type designer / type foundry contact info on some

https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/typography/vendors/
This check verifies whether or not a given font&#x27;s vendor ID is registered in
that list or if it has some of the default values used by the most common font
editors.
Each new FontBakery release includes a cached copy of that list of vendor IDs.
If you registered recently, you&#x27;re safe to ignore warnings emitted by this
check, since your ID will soon be included in one of our upcoming releases.</pre>

<pre>--- Rationale ---
Microsoft keeps a list of font vendors and their respective contact info. This
list is updated regularly and is indexed by a 4-char &quot;Vendor ID&quot; which is stored
in the achVendID field of the OS/2 table.
Registering your ID is not mandatory, but it is a good practice since some
applications may display the type designer / type foundry contact info on some
dialog and also because that info will be visible on Microsoft&#x27;s website:
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/typography/vendors/
This check verifies whether or not a given font&#x27;s vendor ID is registered in
that list or if it has some of the default values used by the most common font
editors.
Each new FontBakery release includes a cached copy of that list of vendor IDs.
If you registered recently, you&#x27;re safe to ignore warnings emitted by this
check, since your ID will soon be included in one of our upcoming releases.</pre>

* ⚠ **WARN** OS/2 VendorID value 'NONE' is not yet recognized. If you registered it recently, then it's safe to ignore this warning message. Otherwise, you should set it to your own unique 4 character code, and register it with Microsoft at https://www.microsoft.com/typography/links/vendorlist.aspx

* [com.google.fonts/check/contour_count](https://font-bakery.readthedocs.io/en/latest/fontbakery/profiles/googlefonts.html#com.google.fonts/check/contour_count)
<pre>--- Rationale ---
Visually QAing thousands of glyphs by hand is tiring. Most glyphs can only be
constructured in a handful of ways. This means a glyph&#x27;s contour count will only
differ slightly amongst different fonts, e.g a &#x27;g&#x27; could either be 2 or 3
contours, depending on whether its double story or single story.
However, a quotedbl should have 2 contours, unless the font belongs to a display
family.
This check currently does not cover variable fonts because there&#x27;s plenty of
alternative ways of constructing glyphs with multiple outlines for each feature
in a VarFont. The expected contour count data for this check is currently
optimized for the typical construction of glyphs in static fonts.</pre>

* ⚠ **WARN** This check inspects the glyph outlines and detects the total number of contours in each of them. The expected values are infered from the typical ammounts of contours observed in a large collection of reference font families. The divergences listed below may simply indicate a significantly different design on some of your glyphs. On the other hand, some of these may flag actual bugs in the font such as glyphs mapped to an incorrect codepoint. Please consider reviewing the design and codepoint assignment of these to make sure they are correct.

The following glyphs do not have the recommended number of contours:

Glyph name: uni2113	Contours detected: 1	Expected: 2
Glyph name: fi	Contours detected: 2	Expected: 3

<pre>--- Rationale ---
According to a GlyphsApp tutorial [1], in order to make sure all versions of
Windows recognize it as a valid font file, we must make sure that the
concatenated length of the familyname (NameID.FONT_FAMILY_NAME) and style
(NameID.FONT_SUBFAMILY_NAME) strings in the name table do not exceed 20
characters.
After discussing the problem in more detail at `FontBakery issue #2179 [2] we
decided that allowing up to 27 chars would still be on the safe side, though.

<summary>⚠ <b>WARN:</b> Ensure fonts have ScriptLangTags declared on the 'meta' table.</summary>

* [com.google.fonts/check/meta/script_lang_tags](https://font-bakery.readthedocs.io/en/latest/fontbakery/profiles/googlefonts.html#com.google.fonts/check/meta/script_lang_tags)
<pre>--- Rationale ---
The OpenType &#x27;meta&#x27; table originated at Apple. Microsoft added it to OT with
just two DataMap records:
- dlng: comma-separated ScriptLangTags that indicate which scripts, or languages
and scripts, with possible variants, the font is designed for
- slng: comma-separated ScriptLangTags that indicate which scripts, or languages
and scripts, with possible variants, the font supports
The slng structure is intended to describe which languages and scripts the font
overall supports. For example, a Traditional Chinese font that also contains
Latin characters, can indicate Hant,Latn, showing that it supports Hant, the
Traditional Chinese variant of the Hani script, and it also supports the Latn
script
The dlng structure is far more interesting. A font may contain various glyphs,
but only a particular subset of the glyphs may be truly &quot;leading&quot; in the design,
while other glyphs may have been included for technical reasons. Such a
Traditional Chinese font could only list Hant there, showing that it’s designed
for Traditional Chinese, but the font would omit Latn, because the developers
don’t think the font is really recommended for purely Latin-script use.
The tags used in the structures can comprise just script, or also language and
script. For example, if a font has Bulgarian Cyrillic alternates in the locl
feature for the cyrl BGR OT languagesystem, it could also indicate in dlng
explicitly that it supports bul-Cyrl. (Note that the scripts and languages in
meta use the ISO language and script codes, not the OpenType ones).
This check ensures that the font has the meta table containing the slng and dlng
structures.
All families in the Google Fonts collection should contain the &#x27;meta&#x27; table.
Windows 10 already uses it when deciding on which fonts to fall back to. The
Google Fonts API and also other environments could use the data for smarter
filtering. Most importantly, those entries should be added to the Noto fonts.
In the font making process, some environments store this data in external files
already. But the meta table provides a convenient way to store this inside the
font file, so some tools may add the data, and unrelated tools may read this
data. This makes the solution much more portable and universal.</pre>

* [com.google.fonts/check/outline_alignment_miss](https://font-bakery.readthedocs.io/en/latest/fontbakery/profiles/<Section: Outline Correctness Checks>.html#com.google.fonts/check/outline_alignment_miss)
<pre>--- Rationale ---
This check heuristically looks for on-curve points which are close to, but do
not sit on, significant boundary coordinates. For example, a point which has a
Y-coordinate of 1 or -1 might be a misplaced baseline point. As well as the
baseline, here we also check for points near the x-height (but only for lower
case Latin letters), cap-height, ascender and descender Y coordinates.
Not all such misaligned curve points are a mistake, and sometimes the design may
call for points in locations near the boundaries. As this check is liable to
generate significant numbers of false positives, it will pass if there are more
than 100 reported misalignments.</pre>

* ⚠ **WARN** The following glyphs have on-curve points which have potentially incorrect y coordinates:
	* exclam (U+0021): X=88.0,Y=-1.0 (should be at baseline 0?)

<pre>--- Rationale ---
This check looks for outline segments which seem particularly short (less than
0.6% of the overall path length).
This check is not run for variable fonts, as they may legitimately have short
